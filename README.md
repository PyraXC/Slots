This slot machine was created because I love gambling and had extra time in college(and perhaps not enough money) to write this up. 
The application runs in command prompt and is a very simplified version of a slot machine that I wanted to make as similar to exisiting slot machines. 
The program has a "debug" mode that I used to test payout percentages and tweak numbers.
Data.txt includes some results of payout.
